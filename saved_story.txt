The mahogany frame, intricately carved with gargoyles and grotesqueries, was the first thing that drew Sarah's gaze. It stood amidst the discarded remnants of a life once lived, a silent sentinel in the hushed chaos of the estate sale. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the dusty attic window, illuminating the mirror's surface with an almost ethereal glow. As she neared, her reflection rippled, distorted, drawing her in with an irresistible allure. It was beautiful, undeniably, but beneath the veneer of aged elegance, a chill whispered down her spine. Perhaps it was the way the gargoyles seemed to leer, their carved smiles almost predatory, or the palpable sense of ancient energy emanating from the cold glass. 

"Don't worry, they can only enter your home, not ours."

The handwritten note, tucked beneath a chipped porcelain doll at the mirror's base, startled a nervous laugh from Sarah's lips. A prank, she thought, her fingers tracing the faded ink. Someone's idea of dark humor. Yet, as her fingers brushed against the cool glass of the mirror's surface, the laughter died in her throat. A fleeting image, a flicker of movement too swift to discern, danced at the edge of her reflection. She whirled around, heart pounding, but the attic remained empty, silent save for the creaking of the old house settling around her. 

The drive back to her Victorian home, inherited from her eccentric great-aunt and filled with its own share of whispered histories, did little to ease the unsettling feeling that clung to Sarah like cobwebs. The mirror, propped against the passenger seat, seemed to watch her, the gargoyles' expressions shifting subtly with the changing light. "Don't be ridiculous," she muttered, her voice wavering slightly. It was just an old mirror, a beautiful antique.  The note was nothing more than a cruel joke. 

Nightfall brought with it a palpable change in the atmosphere of the house. A sudden chill seeped through the rooms, despite the warmth of the late summer evening. Floorboards groaned underfoot, and shadows stretched and danced in the flickering gaslight, taking on sinister forms. Unpacking the mirror in the quiet solitude of her study, Sarah felt a prickle of unease. It was then, as she hung the heavy frame above her antique writing desk, that she saw it again. 

A face, pale and gaunt, with eyes that burned like hot coals, stared back at her from the depths of the reflection. A scream caught in her throat, a strangled gasp that died unheard in the stillness of the house. And then, as quickly as it had appeared, it was gone. Only her own startled reflection remained, framed by the grotesque carvings of the antique mirror. 
The ringing of Sarah's phone shattered the tense silence in the study. Exhaling shakily, she fumbled for the device, her gaze darting nervously between the phone and the antique mirror. The caller ID flashed 'Emma,' her best friend and voice of reason in Sarah's often overly imaginative world. 

"You won't believe what I found," Emma's voice, usually bubbly and bright, was tinged with a rare seriousness, "It's about your mirror."

Before Sarah could even respond, another voice, breathless and laced with worry, chimed in. "Is it true? Did you really buy the Blackwood Mirror?" It was Rose, their friend and resident expert on all things paranormal. 

A chill snaked down Sarah's spine. The Blackwood Mirror. So it had a name, and judging by the fear in Rose's voice, a history. "How...how did you know?" Sarah stammered, her fingers tightening around the phone.

"Doesn't matter," Emma cut in, her voice taking on an edge of urgency, "Just promise me you haven't hung it up yet. Rose found something, something you need to see before you do anything else."
